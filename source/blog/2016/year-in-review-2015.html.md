## Overview

2015 was potentially the best if not, the most productive year of my life. While the first quarter may have been the least productived/ most dismal. Leaving my previous employer, taking time to explore my own career, setting attainable goals and planning my own self improvement after that made the last 3 quarters far out-wiegh the first.

### Setting my 2015 goals.

I think the real start of my 2016 success was the launch of the redesign of my personal site. Even now it is still pretty bare-bones but I had one key goal for it, and in that regard it succeeded.

> By displaying the empty spaces in what I did/what I could do, I was greatly motivated to fill in those blanks.

My key objective for building out this site was to have sections for what I wanted to say about myself as opposed to what was currently true. My plan wasn't to lie to fill in the blanks, but rather to leave them blank, highlighting the literal gaps in who I wanted to be professionally. This was a bit of a gamble as one outcome could've just been an empty website. Thankfully though I started to fill them in.

### The Dangers of self-evaluation.

These blanks in experience and accomplishments though were not quite goal setting, but rather self-evaluation. There was a lot I wanted to be doing that I wasn't doing. This can be a bit depressing. Around February when I had figured most of it out, I realized there was no way for me to do what I wanted to do from where I was.

> So I quit.

My previous job did not afford time for me to work on projects outside of work (and if I had the time, I was too exhausted), and this lack of time extended towards other areas as well, such as finding ways to share my knowledge, participate in meetup groups and more. I wanted to step up my life and figure out more of who i was and where I wanted to be. So I quit. This made April the real start of the year for me as I began to explore where I could take things and what I wanted to do.
